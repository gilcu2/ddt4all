# ECU file

ECU are like microcomputers in the car that understand a telnet kind of language. 
ECU.zip file contains a lots of ECU language definitions for different cars.
The python3 DDT4All version come without this file. In order to work it is needed to download it. 
I have found some downloading the DDT4All Windows version installer, installing and copy from c:\Program Files (x86)\ddt4all
